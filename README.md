# Warehouse Simulation Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a warehouse simulation application using Tauri and React. It integrates Rust for the simulation engine and a modern web UI for interaction and visualization.

## Milestones

- **Initial Setup**  
  Establish project structure, initialize Tauri with React frontend, and set up version control.

- **Basic Simulation Engine**  
  Implement the warehouse model in Rust with slots, occupancy, and simple manipulation commands.

- **UI Integration**  
  Connect the Rust simulation with the React frontend using Tauri commands and API invocations.

- **Advanced Features**  
  Expand simulation capabilities, add visualization, and implement warehouse management features like item adding/removing.

- **Testing & Optimization**  
  Test the simulation, optimize performance, and refine UI/UX based on feedback.

## Documentation

A detailed project background and analysis is available in the [Report](./docs/Report.pdf).
